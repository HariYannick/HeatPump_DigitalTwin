## Node-RED Flow representing the DT of a Heat Pump Test Bench: Verzion 1 on 04 / 2025

### Using this flow: import the .json file on a Node-RED Platform

### Proposed Functionality on Human Machine Interface:

 1) Interactive dashboard of Heat Pump's Sensor and Actuator datas
 2) Sending Command Control to Heat Pump's Air-Heater
 3) Twin of a PID Corrector
