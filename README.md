Flow representing the DT of a Heat Pump Test Bench : Verzion 1 on 04 / 2025

Proposed Functionality on HMI :

 1) Interactive dashboard of Heat Pump's Sensor and Actuator datas
 2) Sending Command Control to Heat Pump's Air-Heater
 3) Twin of a PID Corrector

Simulation Abilities : Add assets on the semantic Digital Model on this flow Then view all data modifications
