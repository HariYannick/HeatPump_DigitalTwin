## Node-RED Flow representing the DT of a Heat Pump Test Bench: Verzion 1 on 04 / 2025

### Using this flow: import the .json file on a Node-RED Platform

### Communication from and to the DT is encrypted (Privacy Precaution):
This capture of network traffic to the DT allows to attest the sending of the SSL certificate to the DT with public key exchange
